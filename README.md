# Getting Started#
uBiome provides access to the raw data from your sample.
The tools here will make it easier to understand the information
in those data files.

Before you begin, you will need:

1. An account with http://ubiome.com
2. Access to [R](http://www.r-project.org), the (free) open source
 scientific programming language, available for Mac/Windows/Unix.
