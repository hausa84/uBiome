Last year I started to notice my sleep becoming less regular. Nothing serious — thankfully, I’ve never had sleep problems — but I was waking up too early, and I didn’t seem to be quite as refreshed. Maybe it’s just a sign of age, I thought, but then I read in Martin Blaser’s excellent book *Missing Microbes* (p.304)  that most (80%) of the sleep- and mood-regulating neurotransmitter serotonin [is made in the gut](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22968153). Can microbes affect sleep?

A few internet searches later led me to evidence that [*B. infantis* modulates tryptophan](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/7/3047.long), the stuff in turkey that urban legends have long blamed for [that sleepy feeling](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/the-truth-about-tryptophan) you get after Thanksgiving dinner.   Seemed like a good target to check, and because I’m a long-time uBiome fan —- I supported them on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubiome-sequencing-your-microbiome/x/2449702) almost two years ago -- my  first step was to look at my gut biome results to see my levels of *bifidobacterium*.

As I suspected, I had no *B. infantis*, and in fact my overall *bifido* numbers were pretty low. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mayBifido<-may[may$tax_name=="Bifidobacterium",]
mayBifidoFrame<-data.frame(mayBifido$count_norm,mayBifido$tax_name)
names(mayBifidoFrame)<-c("count_norm","tax_name")
mayBifidoFrame
```

You may already know about *pre-biotics*, foods that feed bacteria, as opposed to *pro-biotics*, which are simply pills or foods that already contain a bunch of (presumably) beneficial microbes. Lately a number of people have noticed that a particular kind of starch, so-called [*resistant starch*](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-definitive-guide-to-resistant-starch/) is a prebiotic that acts like a yummy smorgasboard for *bifido* and other bacteria. I followed [a protocol](http://www.gestaltreality.com/2014/02/27/resistant-starch-a-concise-guide/) that uses plain ole [Bob's Red Mill Potato Starch](http://www.bobsredmill.com/potato-starch.html) (easy to find any nice grocery store): just a couple of tablespoons an hour before bedtime to give the starch time to make it to the upper colon where the *bifido* live.

Whoah! You wouldn't believe how wonderfully I slept that night. Over 8 hours of rock-solid, uninterrupted sleep, and more vivid dreams than I've had in years. It was amazing!

After a few days of this, I submitted another sample to uBiome for testing:
![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardsprague/uBiome/master/images/screenshot_bifido_oct2014.jpg
)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
octBifido <- oct[oct$tax_name=="Bifidobacterium",]
octBifidoFrame<-data.frame(octBifido$count_norm,octBifido$tax_name)
names(octBifidoFrame)<-c("count_norm","tax_name")
octBifidoFrame
```
Look at that! Up from 8,473 to almost 60,000 -- for my gut microbes, that is what you call a *bloom*!

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
